                # Weighted Method per Class (WMC) Stability Metric

                The Weighted Method per Class (WMC) metric measures the sum of the complexities of the methods in a class, reflecting its overall complexity.

                ## Calculation:
                If all method complexities are considered to be unity, then WMC = n,the number of methods. Otherwise, it's (âˆ‘Ci) from i = 1 to n, where Ci is previously estimated complexity of the class i.
                
                ## Interpretation:
                - A **higher WMC** value indicates greater complexity, which can make the class harder to understand, maintain, and test.
                - A **lower WMC** value suggests simplicity and better maintainability.

                ## Usage:
                Use the WMC metric to evaluate the structural complexity of classes and identify candidates for refactoring to improve code quality and maintainability.
