                WMC is measures the sum of complexity of the methods in a class.
                
                If all method complexities are considered to be unity, then WMC = n,the number of methods. Otherwise, it's (âˆ‘Ci) from i = 1 to n, where Ci is previously estimated complexity of the class i.
                
                The larger the value, the more complex and potentially incorrect the structure of the class.
